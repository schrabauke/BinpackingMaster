    """ Modified First-Fit Decreasing bin-packing heuristic.
    Accepted Keyword Arguments:
     key : A callable which takes one argument and returns a value which can
            be __cmp__'d against the supplied binsize. This is (intentionally)
            identical to the sort() builtin's key= argument). Defaults to
            lambda x:x
     binsize: The capacity of a bin. Defaults to 800.
     bins: Any already-sorted bins. Default to nothing (ie, [[]]).
    According to Wikipedia;
    "MFFD[5] (a variant of FFD) uses no more than 71/60 OPT + 1 bins[6]
    (i.e. bounded by about 1.18×opt, compared to about 1.22×opt for FFD)."
    The following description of the MFFD algorithm can be retrieved from

    ============================================================================
    Let lst denote the list of items to be bin-packed, let x denote the size of
    the smallest element in lst, and let cap denote the capacity of one bin.
    lst is split into the four sub-lists, lA, lB, lC, lD.
    lA: All items strictly larger than cap/2.
    lB: All items of size at most cap/2 and strictly larger than cap/3.
    lC: All items of size at most cap/3 and strictly larger than (cap - x)/5.
    lD: The rest, i.e., all items of size at most (cap - x)/5.
    Items are placed as follows:
    1. Create a list of length lA bins. Place each item in lA into its own
       bin (while maintaining relative item order with respect to lst).
       Note: relevant published analysis assumes that lst is sorted in order of
       decreasing size.
    2. Take the list of bins created in Step 1 and reverse it.
    3. Sequentially consider each bin b. If the two smallest items in lC do NOT
       fit together into b of if there a less than two items remaining in lC,
       then pack nothing into b and move on to the next bin (if any). If they do
       fit together, then find the largest item x1 in lC that would fit together
       with the smallest item in lC into b. Remove x1 from lC. Then find the
       largest item x2, x2 != x1, in lC that will now fit into b together with
       x1. Remove x1* from lC. Place both x1 and x2 into b and move on to the
       next item.
    4. Reverse the list of bins again.
    5. Use the FirstFit heuristic to place all remaining items, i.e., lB, lD,
       and any remaining items of lC.
